## 6 - Creating Your Own Repository

So far, you’ve been working with an existing repository. Now it’s time to create your **own** repository.  
This is how you’ll start new projects, share your work, and collaborate with others.

---

### 6.1 - Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.  
2. Click the **+** icon in the top-right corner and select **New repository**.  
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: choose something short and descriptive (e.g. `project-analysis` or `notebook-examples`).  
   - **Description**: optional, but helpful for others (and your future self).  
   - **Visibility**:  
     - **Private** if it contains sensitive/unfinished work.  
     - **Public** if it’s safe to share openly. *(Remember: even if you later make it public, the full commit history will still be visible!)*  
4. Tick **Add a README file** — this creates a starting point.  
5. Optionally tick **Add .gitignore** (choose a language to ignore unnecessary files, like temporary outputs). 
6. Optionally tick **Add license** - MIT is a good one to use. 
6. Click **Create repository**.

You now have an empty repository on GitHub, ready to use.

### 6.2 - Clone Your Repository Locally

To work on your repository from your computer:  

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.  
2. Go to **File → Clone Repository → URL**.  
3. Paste the URL of your new repository (shown on GitHub).  
4. Choose your `GitHub` folder as the local path.  
5. Click **Clone**.  

Your local copy is now linked to your online repository.

### 6.3 - Add Your First File

1. On your computer, open the repository folder you just cloned.  
2. Create a new file (e.g., `README.md` if you didn’t add one earlier, or `notes.txt`).  
3. Save the file.  
4. Open GitHub Desktop — you’ll see the new file listed under **Changes**.  
5. Write a commit message (e.g., “Add first file”) and click **Commit to main**.  
6. Click **Push origin** to upload the file to your GitHub repository.  

Refresh your repository page on GitHub and you should see the new file online!

### 6.4 - Best Practices When Creating Repositories

- **Keep names short but descriptive** (avoid spaces; use hyphens or underscores).  
- **Use a README** to explain what the repository is for.  
- **Add a .gitignore** to avoid uploading unnecessary files (large data files, temporary logs, etc.).  
- **Think about visibility** — start private if in doubt, and only make public when the project is ready and anonymised.  
- **Commit often** with meaningful messages (so you can track what changed and why).

### 6.5 - Writing a Good README

The **README.md** file is the first thing people see when they visit your repository.  
It explains *what the project is, how to use it, and why it exists*. Even if you’re the only person using the repo, your future self will thank you for writing a clear README!

The README is written using markdown syntax. A handy guide on how to use this can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

A typical README might include:

1. **Project Title** — a clear name for the repository.  
2. **Description** — what the project does, and why it exists.  
3. **Installation instructions** (if code needs to be run).  
4. **Usage examples** — how to run scripts or use the project.  
5. **Dependencies** — list of packages or tools needed.  
6. **Contributing guidelines** — optional, but useful for collaborations.  
7. **License** — defines how others can use your code (if public).  

A template README can be found [here](https://github.com/baillielab/GitHub_Tutorial/blob/main/example_README.md) - feel free to download and edit this.

### 6.6 - Suggested File Structure

When projects grow, it’s important to keep things organised.
A simple and effective folder layout might look like this:

My_Project/
│
├── README.md          <- Project overview
├── data/              <- Raw data (often kept local if large/private)
├── scripts/           <- Code and analysis scripts
├── figures/           <- Plots and images generated by scripts
├── outputs/           <- Processed data or results
└── docs/              <- Documentation, notes, or reports

Notes:
- Keep raw data separate from processed data (so you never overwrite your originals).
- Don’t upload very large datasets to GitHub (use .gitignore to exclude them).
- Scripts should be reusable (e.g., analysis.py instead of analysis_for_today.py - don't hardcode things wherever possible).
- Figures and outputs can be re-generated from the scripts and data — only save what you need.
- The README should explain what each folder is for.

### After this section you should be able to:

- Create a new repository on GitHub.  
- Clone your repository to your computer.  
- Add files, commit them, and push them online.  
- Write a clear and informative README file.  
- Organise your project using a sensible folder structure (e.g., `data/`, `scripts/`, `figures/`, `outputs/`).  
- Apply best practices for naming, `.gitignore`, and repository visibility.  
- Understand how to structure your repository for collaboration and future use.
