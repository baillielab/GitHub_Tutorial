## 3 - Exploring a Repository on GitHub

Before cloning a repository to your computer, it’s helpful to look at it on the **GitHub website**. This gives you an overview of its structure, files, and activity.

### 3.1 - Open the Repository

Go to the Baillie Lab GitHub Tutorial repository:  
[https://github.com/baillielab/GitHub_Tutorial](https://github.com/baillielab/GitHub_Tutorial)

### 3.2 - Navigating the Repository

Once on the repository page, take note of:

- **Repository name** – shows at the top (e.g., `GitHub_Tutorial`).  
- **README.md** – displays automatically below the file list; usually contains instructions, project overview, or important notes.  
- **File list** – shows the project’s folders and files. You can click on a file to view its contents.  
- **Branches** – check the branch dropdown near the top-left to see if there are multiple versions.  
- **Commit history** – click on the **Commits** link to see all changes made to the repo, who made them, and when.

*Tip: The GitHub website is a good place to explore a repo without making any changes. You can also preview files, review changes, and copy code snippets.*

### 3.3 - Understanding Key Sections

- **Code Tab** – default view showing files and folders.  
- **Issues Tab** – a place for reporting bugs or requesting features.  
- **Pull Requests Tab** – shows proposed changes that contributors want to merge.  
- **Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights** – optional sections that may exist depending on the repository setup.
