# GitHub Tutorial

## 1 - Initial Setup

Before you can start working with GitHub, you’ll need to create an account, install the tools, and set up a workspace on your computer.

### 1.1 - Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/).
2. Click **Sign Up** and follow the instructions to create an account.
3. Use a strong, secure password and enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for added security.  
4. It’s generally recommended to use a **personal email address** instead of a work email. That way, if you change jobs, you’ll still have access to your account.

### 1.2 - Install GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a beginner-friendly application that makes it easier to work with Git repositories without using the command line.

1. Download GitHub Desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Install the application and log in with your GitHub username and password.
3. Once logged in, you can connect GitHub Desktop to your repositories online and sync changes between your computer and GitHub.

*Tip: Advanced users may also want to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) directly to use command-line tools, but GitHub Desktop is perfect for getting started.*

### 1.3 - Set Up a GitHub Folder

To stay organized, it’s a good idea to create a dedicated folder on your computer for your projects:

1. Create a folder named **GitHub** (or simply **Git**) in a location that’s easy to find, such as:
   - **Documents/GitHub**
   - **Desktop/GitHub**
2. This folder will act as the main location where you’ll store all your cloned or created repositories.
3. When you clone a repository from GitHub, save it inside this folder so everything stays organized.

At this stage, you should have:
- A GitHub account  
- GitHub Desktop installed and logged in  
- A GitHub folder ready for your projects
