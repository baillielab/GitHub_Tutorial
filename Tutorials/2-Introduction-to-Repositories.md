## 2 - Introduction to Repositories

A **repository** (often shortened to **repo**) is where an individual project lives on GitHub.  
Repositories store all the files, folders, and version history for a project.  

You can:
- Create and manage your own repositories.  
- View other people’s repositories.  
- Contribute to shared repositories — enabling transparent, collaborative working.

### 2.1 - Public vs Private Repositories

- **Public Repositories**  
  Anyone can view the contents of a public repo, even without a GitHub account.  
  - Example: [genomicc-workflows](https://github.com/baillielab/genomicc-workflows) is a public repository — accessible to everyone.  

- **Private Repositories**  
  Only people who are explicitly invited can see and access private repos.  
  - Example: [baillielab-notes](https://github.com/baillielab/baillielab-notes) is private — if you’re not registered as a member of the Baillie Lab GitHub organisation, you won’t be able to access it.

### 2.2 - The Baillie Lab Organisation

The [Baillie Lab GitHub organisation](https://github.com/baillielab) contains a mix of public and private repositories.  
- Public repositories are visible to everyone.  
- Private repositories require membership.  

If you’ve just created your GitHub account, you’ll still be able to see the public repositories, but not the private ones.

### 2.3 - Best Practices: Choosing Public vs Private

When deciding whether a repository should be **public** or **private**, keep the following in mind:

- **Start Private, Stay Private (if sensitive data is involved).**  
  If a repository ever contains identifiable, confidential, or unpublished data, it should **remain private permanently**.  

- **Be cautious about “flipping” from private to public.**  
  Making a private repo public will expose the *entire commit history* — including old files and previous versions.  
  Even if you later delete sensitive files, they may still be visible in the history.  

- **If you plan to make a repo public later:**  
  - Start the repo as public from the beginning (but only if you’re certain no sensitive data will be added).  
  - Or, keep the repo private until it’s “ready,” then create a **fresh public repo** and copy across only the files that are safe to share.  

- **Rule of thumb:**  
  If you’re unsure whether data might ever need to remain private, **keep the repository private**. You can always publish safe outputs separately.
