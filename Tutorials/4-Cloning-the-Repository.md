## 4 - Cloning the Repository

Now that you’ve explored the repository on GitHub, the next step is to **clone it to your local computer**. This creates a copy of the repository where you can view, edit, and experiment with files without affecting the online version until you push changes.

### 4.1 - Using GitHub Desktop to Clone

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.  
2. Go to **File → Clone Repository**. This will bring up a list of the repositories you are a contributor of/have explicit access to. If you've just created your account there will be nothing here yet! 
3. Click the **URL tab**.  
4. Paste the repository URL: https://github.com/baillielab/GitHub_Tutorial
5. Choose the **local path** — ideally your `GitHub` folder created earlier.  
6. Click **Clone**.

GitHub Desktop will now download the repository to your computer. You can see the files and commit history locally.
You will also see the repo in your dropdown list of 'current repository' for easy access:

### 4.2 - Verify the Clone

- Navigate to your 'GitHub' or 'Git' folder where you cloned the repo - you should now see it!
- Open the cloned folder on your computer: you should see the same structure as on GitHub (`Images/`, `Tutorials/`, etc.).  
- In GitHub Desktop, check that the repository name appears and that the **Current Branch** is set to `main`.  
- You can now start exploring files locally or make changes safely.

### 4.3 - Note About Public Repositories

**Important:**  
- While anyone can clone a public repository, **only people with write access can push changes** back to the original repository.  
- We will cover how to work on a public repo but with version control in the next tutorial

After cloning, you should:
- Have a local copy of the repository.  
- See the same folder structure and files as online.
